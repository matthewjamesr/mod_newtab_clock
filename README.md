## This is a module for Breach.cc browser.

It is the start of a sync'd new tab page, such as how Google Chroms synch's your browsing experience.

Currently this module will be renamed to ```mod_synch```. It will incorporate a synched account across multiple systems with a tag-based bookmark system. Top tags appear at the top right of the page.
